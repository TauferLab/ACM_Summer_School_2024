# Enabling Scientific Discovery: Harnessing the Power of the National Science Data Fabric for Large-Scale Data Analysis

## Abstract

In this interactive half-day tutorial, participants explore the advanced applications of the National Science Data Fabric [(NSDF) services](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/) and comprehensive strategies for end-to-end scientific data analysis. The tutorial targets a broad audience, from researchers and students to developers and scientists, each finding valuable insights into managing and analyzing large datasets, with a particular focus on datasets exceeding 100TB. 
Attendees gain hands-on experience constructing modular workflows, leveraging public and private data storage and streaming solutions, and deploying sophisticated visualization and analysis dashboards for scientific
discovery. 
The tutorial highlights NSDF's role in supporting the VIS conference's themes by providing scalable solutions for advances in visualization and visual analytics. It covers various topics, from an overview of NSDF's capabilities to addressing common pain points in data analysis to intermediate hands-on exercises using NSDF services for Earth science data and advanced applications, including handling and visualizing massive datasets in domains requiring high-resolution data management.
Participants leave a deeper understanding of how NSDF services integrate into their research workflows to enhance data accessibility, sharing, and collaborative scientific discovery. This tutorial advances the knowledge of data-intensive computing and empowers attendees to harness the full potential of NSDF in their fields.

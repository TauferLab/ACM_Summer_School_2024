# GEOtiled

## About

Terrain parameters such as slope, aspect, and hillshading are essential in various applications, including agriculture, forestry, 
and hydrology. However, generating high-resolution terrain parameters is computationally intensive, making it challenging to 
provide these value-added products to communities in need. We present a scalable workflow called GEOtiled that leverages data 
partitioning to accelerate the computation of terrain parameters from digital elevation models, while preserving accuracy.

This repository contains the library for all functions used for GEOtiled, and includes a Jupyter Notebook walking through 
GEOtiled's workflow and function features.

## Installation

### Install Conda
> If you already have Conda installed on your machine, skip to Install GEOtiled
1. Download Anaconda
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
2. Run the downloaded file and agree to all prompts
```
bash ./Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
3. Restart the shell to complete the installation

### Install GEOtiled

1. Create a new conda environment
   > Note: This process might take some time
```
conda create -n geotiled -c conda-forge gdal=3.8.0
```
2. Change to the new environment
```
conda activate geotiled
```
3. Clone the repository in a desired working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/TauferLab/GEOtiled
```
4. Change to the geotiled directory
   > Note: `your_path` should be replaced with your working directory
```
cd your_path/GEOtiled/geotiled
```
5. Install editable library
```
pip install -e .
```

> Note: Installations can be verified with `conda list`

## How to Use the Library

1. Ensure you are in the correct conda environment
```
conda activate geotiled
```
2. Place the following code snippet towards the top of any Python code to use GEOtiled functions
```
import geotiled
```
> Note: Documentation on functions can be found under docs/build/html/index.html

## How to Run the Demo

1. Install Jupyter Notebook in the geotiled conda environment
```
pip install notebook
```
2. Go to the GEOtiled directory
```
cd your_path/GEOtiled
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Navigate to the 'demo' folder and run the notebook 'demo.ipynb'
